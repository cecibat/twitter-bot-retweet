# twitter-bot-retweet
The repository contains a Twitter bot implemented in Python 3.7.6 using Tweepy 4.1.0.
The bot retweets and likes the latest _num_items_ tweets containing the _keyword_ either as an hashtag or in the body text. A log is printed out for record.
The parameters required to be inputted are described in the docstring in the cip_bot_twitter.py file.

To run the bot, a Twitter developer account is needed and the corresponding access/token keys must be inputted in the config.py file.
